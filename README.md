# What I Implemented
1. Basic stack functions including peek(), pop(), push()
2. Test program to test stack functions
3. infixToPostfix() method to convert a math expression (inputed as string) in normal infix form to postfix form
4. postfixEval() method to evaluate math expression (inputed as string) in postfixform
